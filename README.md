# DNA MUTATION API

This is a REST API through which NxN type arrays can be passed and it determines whether it is mutated DNA or not.
To do this, the array has to be passed through a post method of the type:
POST → /mutation/

{

“dna”:["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]

}

This can be done with many programs, for example Postman.
